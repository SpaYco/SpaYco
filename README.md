### Hi there 👋

my name is Aziz Mejri from Tunis, Tunisia, I'm a Full-Stack web developer that's leaning more toward Front-End, over the last year, I've used my skills to make lots of projects and helping others with their bugs that they face during studying with me on Microverse (a remote full-stack development program with an emphasis on pair programming).
